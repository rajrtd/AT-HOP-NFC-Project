# AT-HOP-NFC-Project
### Authors:  Raj Rathod, Benjamin Fuentes and Sean Simpkins.


## General info
***The purpose of this project is to research the NFC technology, in this project you will see a prototype application that showcases an e-wallet. 
This wallet contains 'cards' which work like RFID tags utilizing NFC on an android phone. This application is still in progress.
Our intent is to learn the implementation of HCE (Host Card Emulation), we have managed to successfully send a APDU command via NFC but we have not been
able to successfully send a full NDEF message through NFC. We are doing further research on NDEF to greatly understand the implementation.***
