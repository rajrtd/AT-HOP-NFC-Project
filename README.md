# AT-HOP-NFC-Project
### Authors:  Raj Rathod, Benjamin Fuentes and Sean Simpkins.


## General info
***The purpose of this project is to research the NFC technology, in this project you will see a prototype application that showcases an e-wallet. 
This wallet contains 'cards' which work like RFID tags utilizing NFC on an android phone. This application is still in progress.
Our intent is to learn the implementation of HCE (Host Card Emulation), we have managed to successfully send a APDU command via NFC but we have not been
able to successfully send a full NDEF message through NFC. We are doing further research on NDEF to greatly understand the implementation.***


## Programming language used and Android versions.
1. For this application we used IntelliJ version 2021.1 as our IDE.
2. We wrote all our code in Kotlin, XML and a tiny bit of Javascript.
3. Firebase is our database of choice.
4. API Level 21 (lollipop 5.0) for the Android app
5. SDK Java version 11.
